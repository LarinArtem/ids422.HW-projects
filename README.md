Machine Learning and Neural Networks Coursework (IDS 422)
This repository documents a comprehensive set of machine-learning assignments completed as part of the IDS 422: Machine Learning course. The project emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of modern machine-learning techniques, with a particular focus on neural networks and natural-language processing.
The coursework begins with foundational experiments in neural network behavior and optimization. Early notebooks analyze and visualize common activation functions—such as hyperbolic tangent (tanh), ReLU, and leaky ReLU—examining their mathematical properties and practical impact on model convergence and performance. These experiments are implemented using PyTorch, with supporting data analysis and visualization performed using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This stage of the project builds intuition around gradient flow, nonlinearity selection, and training stability in deep learning models.
As the course progresses, the repository transitions into applied natural-language processing (NLP). The final project focuses on supervised text classification using the AG News dataset, consisting of over 120,000 training articles and 7,600 test articles across multiple news categories. Raw text data is preprocessed and tokenized using Gensim, and distributed word representations are learned via Word2Vec embeddings. These embeddings serve as inputs to a neural-network classifier implemented in PyTorch.
The classification pipeline leverages PyTorch’s TensorDataset and DataLoader abstractions to enable efficient mini-batch training, and the model is optimized using the Adam optimizer. Training and evaluation workflows are clearly structured, with performance tracked across epochs and results interpreted in the context of model capacity, embedding quality, and optimization dynamics.
Throughout the repository, each notebook integrates explanatory markdown, experimental results, and visual diagnostics, reflecting a strong emphasis on interpretability and methodological rigor. Collectively, the project demonstrates proficiency in machine-learning fundamentals, deep-learning frameworks, and applied NLP, as well as the ability to translate theoretical concepts into robust, end-to-end implementations using professional Python data-science tools.
